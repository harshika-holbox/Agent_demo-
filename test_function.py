    Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. 
    It encompasses a wide range of capabilities including machine learning, natural language processing, 
    computer vision, and robotics. AI systems can now perform tasks that traditionally required human intelligence, 
    such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and solving complex problems.
    
    The applications of AI are vast and growing rapidly. In healthcare, AI is being used for disease diagnosis, 
    drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans. In finance, it powers fraud detection, algorithmic trading, 
    and risk assessment. In transportation, AI enables autonomous vehicles and smart traffic management systems.
    
    However, the rapid advancement of AI also raises important ethical and societal questions. Concerns about 
    job displacement, privacy, bias in algorithms, and the potential for misuse have sparked global discussions 
    about responsible AI development and deployment.
    
    Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI are enormous. When developed and deployed responsibly, 
    AI can help solve some of humanity's most pressing problems, from climate change to healthcare access. 
    The key is ensuring that AI development is guided by ethical principles and serves the common good.
